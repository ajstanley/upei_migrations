                        <subTitle>Workgroup volunteer board development</subTitle>
                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                    </titleInfo>
                    <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at workgroup boards to identify their
                        motivations and challenges, and to develop recommendations on how to address those challenges.
                        Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that have to both govern and manage because they do not
                        have paid executive staff. This paper looks particularly at volunteer community development
                        organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island who play an important role in their rural
                        communities by providing required infrastructure and services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                        specifically at workgroup boards to identify their motivations and challenges, and to develop
                        recommendations on how to address those challenges. Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that
                        have to both govern and manage because they do not have paid executive staff. This paper looks
                        particularly at volunteer community development organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island
                        who play an important role in their rural communities by providing required infrastructure and
                        services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
                        or some other source. The most important thing for volunteer workgroup boards to understand
                        about improving their effectiveness and volunteer experiences is that it is a continuous process
                        and will require ongoing efforts.

                                    xmlns:srw_dc="info:srw/schema/1/dc-schema">The purpose of this paper is to look
                        specifically at workgroup boards to identify their motivations and challenges, and to develop
                        recommendations on how to address those challenges. Workgroup boards are volunteer boards that
                        have to both govern and manage because they do not have paid executive staff. This paper looks
                        particularly at volunteer community development organizations in Eastern Prince Edward Island
                        who play an important role in their rural communities by providing required infrastructure and
                        services.
                        It was determined through observation, focus groups, and interviews that the challenges these
                        volunteers face include poor time management and lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities.
                        These challenges can cause an organization to be inefficient which, in turn, can contribute to
                        the workgroup boards’ greatest challenge of recruiting and retaining quality volunteers. It is
                        assumed that more effective boards will give rise to a better volunteer experience which will
                        facilitate the recruitment and retention of quality volunteers.
                        There is no one list of practices that every board can implement to improve board effectiveness.
                        Each board must determine what efforts or practices are best for them. However, this report
                        makes recommendations that provide workgroup boards with a place to start. The recommendations
                        include motivating core volunteers to initiate change, participating in training opportunities,
                        having scheduled strategy sessions to discuss the organization’s role and board development
                        plans, and to acknowledge volunteers’ efforts. It was also identified that volunteer workgroup
                        boards will need additional support to be successful in these efforts whether through government
